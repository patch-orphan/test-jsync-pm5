=head1 NAME

Test::JSYNC - Test JSYNC data

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Test::JSYNC v0.02_1.

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Test::JSYNC;

   jsync_ok $jsync,                  'jsync is well formed';
   jsync_is $jsync, $expected_jsync, 'jsync matches what we expected';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

JSON YAML Notation Coding (JSYNC) is an extension of JSON that can serialize any
data objects.  Test::JSYNC makes it easy to verify that you have built valid
JSYNC and that it matches your expected output.

This module uses the L<JSYNC> module, which is currently the only CPAN module to
support JSYNC; however, the module itself states that it “is a very early
release of JSYNC, and should not be used at all unless you know what you are
doing.”

=head1 EXPORTED TESTS

=head2 jsync_ok

Test passes if the string passed is valid JSYNC.

   jsync_ok $jsync, 'jsync is well formed';

C<is_valid_jsync> is provided as an alternative to C<jsync_ok> using the same
naming convention as L<Test::JSON> but is not exported by default.

=head2 jsync_is

Test passes if the two JSYNC strings are valid JSYNC and evaluate to the same
data structure.

   jsync_is $jsync, $expected_jsync, 'jsync matches what we expected';

L<Test::Differences> is used to provide easy diagnostics of why the JSYNC
structures did not match.  For example:

      Failed test 'jsync matches what we expected'
      in t/jsync.t at line 10.

C<is_jsync> is provided as an alternative to C<jsync_is> using the same naming
convention as L<Test::JSON> but is not exported by default.
